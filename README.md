# D3 Website
[app.js](assets/js/app.js) is a program that creates a d3 scatter chart with six sources of [data](assets/data/data.csv), three on each axis. If you click on any of the greyed out axis labels on [this webpage](https://blashford.github.io/D3-Challenge/) the labels and the chart will update accordingly, as well as the tooltips for each circle.
